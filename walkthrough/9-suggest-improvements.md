# 9 - Suggest Improvements
Now that you've been working in a trunk based project using many kind of feature flags, you are asked to reflect around your experience.

- What did you like with this work method?
- What didn't you like?
- Can you come up with a couple of ideas for how to improve the workflow?
	- A change in culture in the dev team?
	- Some improvements to your build pipeline?
	- Some improvements for how to build feature flags? Maybe using a 3rd party tool for it?

Don't forget to [put a green checkmark](README.md) before you continue to the next task!
