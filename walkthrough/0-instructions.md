# Instructions
Your team will follow along in the steps and in each step there will be some part of the Quiz app that needs to be implemented, but it needs to be done in accordance with Continious Delivery. That might be to create a feature flagging system and figure out how to do dark launches, setting up a CD pipeline or using some 3-rd party SaaS tool in order to get the needed user feedback to plug into your CD-loop.

This exercise is not primarily about programming but there will be coding needed in almost every task. However you are not tasked with creating a full quiz app from scratch since the focus on CI/CD will then be lost. Instead you will be given a base to the Quiz app that lacks certain features and when asked to implement a new feature there might be some coding tips or code examples in the walkthough to paste directly into your repo so you've not getting stuck 2 days writing beautiful CSS styling.

## Grading
Your team will recieve one of the following grades: Fail, Pass (G) or Pass with distinction (VG). In order to achieve pass, you need to succesfully complete questions 1 through 5. In order to achieve pass with distinction you need to also complete questions 5 through 8. To achieve pass with distinction you also need to come up with some suggestions for improvements to the development process we're creating in this exercise. Questions 9 and 10 are extra assignments that are optional to do if you've finished the other questions and still feel you have time to spare.

## Examinations
After one week, on Wednesday, each team will get to present their solutions to Questions 1 and 2 and we will compare and see if teams chose different ways of solving those two tasks. This presentation will not be graded, it's just meant to foster some knowledge sharing.

The final examination is your groups fork of this repository together with some questions answered on the course web site. That hand in will be on thursday the last week of the course.
