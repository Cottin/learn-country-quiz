# Instructions
Your team will follow along in the steps and in each step there will be some part of the Quiz app that needs to be implemented, but it needs to be done in accordance with Continious Deployment. That might be to create a feature flagging system and figure out how to do dark launches, setting up a CD pipeline or using some 3-rd party SaaS tool in order to get the needed user feedback to plug into your CD-loop.

This exercise is not primarily about programming but there will be coding needed in almost every task. However you are not tasked with creating a full quiz app from scratch since the focus on CI/CD might then be lost. Instead you will be given a base to the Quiz app that lacks certain features and when asked to implement a new feature there might be some coding tips or code examples in the walkthough to paste directly into your repo so you've not getting stuck 2 days writing beautiful CSS styling.

## Grading
Your team will recieve one of the following grades: Fail, Pass (G) or Pass with distinction (VG). The table below outlines what tasks are needed to be completed in order to achieve a certian grade.

## Examinations
One of the points of this exercise is to compare different solutions and discuss findings and learnings among different teams. Each team will get a chance to demonstrate their solutions and show that the app and feature flagging system actually works for all the others. Probably short demos / presentations around 10 minutes accompanied with some reflections from the team around this work methods.

Also, your groups fork of this repository together with some questions answered on the course web site will also be part of the final examination to show that you did the tasks in the table above.

***NOTE:** I will post clarifications and tips and code examples to the tasks as we go along. So make sure to check your github fork and press "Fetch upstream" if you see there are updates available!*
